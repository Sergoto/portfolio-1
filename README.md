## David Lin's Portfolio Page

This is my first Portfolio Page post graduation from General Assembly's SEI course.

This was inspired while I was looking at some of the more out of the box portfolio pages during my research. 
I wanted to make something that shows what I had learned during my time in the General Assembly bootcamp while still showing a bit of my preferences and styles. 

This portfolio page is designed to look and feel like everyone's favorite code editor VScode that we've all spent hundreds, even thousands of hours on.

I plan to keep working on this and expand it as my skills, projects and career as a software developer grows. 
Thanks for checking it out!
