This is David Lin's first Portfolio Page post graduation from General Assembly's SEI course.

This was inspired while I was looking at some of the more out of the box portfolio pages during my research. 
I wanted to make something that shows what I had learned during my time in the General Assembly bootcamp while still showing a bit of my preferences and styles. 

I plan to keep working on this and expand it as my skills, projects and career as a software developer grows. 
Thanks for checking it out!
